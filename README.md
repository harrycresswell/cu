# cu.css – A modern CSS boilerplate

cu.css is a lightweight starting point for web projects. It makes it quicker to get up and running with [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) and [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/). Though not essential, to get the most out of cu.css it will help to be familiar with both of these methodologies.

cu.css is not a fully fledged CSS framework, like Tailwind or Bootstrap. If anything, it’s more of a boilerplate or starting point, designed to be built upon and expanded as you see fit.

## Features

- Built using the [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology.
- [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) fluid responsive space and type.
- CSS Custom Properties over token-based CSS.
- Work with SCSS or CSS.
- Zero dendencies or third-party tooling.
- Global styles that make HTML look great.
- Automatic “user-preference” dark mode.
- Simple, accessible and intuitive to work with.
- Works with [the grain](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/) of CSS, not against it.
