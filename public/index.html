    <p><em>cu.css</em> is a lightweight CSS framework that makes it quicker to start using <a href="https://cube.fyi/">CUBE CSS</a> and <a href="https://utopia.fyi/">Utopia</a> in your projects. To get the most out of <em>cu.css</em>, you will need to be familiar with both approaches.</p>
<p><em>cu.css</em> is not a fully fledged CSS framework, like Tailwind or Bootstrap. If anything, it’s more of a boilerplate or starting point, designed to be built upon and expanded as you see fit.</p>

    
    
    
      <h2 id="cube-css-in-cu.css">CUBE CSS in cu.css</h2>
      <p><em>cu.css</em>, like CUBE CSS, aims to <strong>broadly style as much as possible at a global level</strong>, then let <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance">the cascade and inheritance</a> – two core features of CSS — do the heavy lifting. This is done by styling <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors#types_of_selectors">Type Selectors</a> to create a set of base a.k.a <a href="/docs/global/">global styles</a> for native HTML elements. The result of which is HTML that looks great, without any additional classes.</p>
<p>Building on these base styles, <em>cu.css</em> takes the concepts of <strong>Compositions, Utilities, Blocks and Exceptions</strong> from CUBE, to create a consistent approach to structuring CSS. In <em>cu.css</em>, you will find a handful of use <a href="/docs/compositions/">Compositions</a>, <a href="/docs/utilities/">Utilities</a> and <a href="/docs/blocks/">Blocks</a> to help kickstart your projects. Exceptions, which deal with state or layout changes, can be found extending Compositions and Blocks.</p>
<p><em>cu.css</em> doesn’t assume you are working with a design system. Therefore there is no abstraction of design tokens away from CSS. This approach is often refered to as <a href="https://cube.fyi/utility.html#token-based-css">token-based CSS</a> and involves an additional data file – JSON or similar. In <em>cu.css</em>, tokens, take the form of CSS Custom Properties, which remain a part of the CSS and permeate through it.</p>
<p>Likewise, <em>cu.css</em> doesn’t make use of any third-party tooling to generate utility classes. Instead, utility classes  are created by hand, as and when they are required.</p>
<p>These decisions help to keep <em>cu.css</em> simple, accessible and intuitive to work with. And perhaps most of all, lightweight and dependency free.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://cube.fyi/">cube.fyi</a> teaches you the methodology, <em>cu.css</em> puts it into practice.</p>

    
      <h2 id="utopia-in-cu.css">Utopia in cu.css</h2>
      <p><a href="https://utopia.fyi/">Utopia</a> is used in <em>cu.css</em> to creates a fluid responsive design system, without the need for breakpoints.</p>
<p>With some clever use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp">Clamp function</a>, Utopia creates a scale of CSS Custom Propoerties for both typography and space, that is utilised by the entire framework to create harmony and rhythm.</p>
<p><em>cu.css</em> uses the Minor Third and Major Third scale to create sensible defaults. However, Utopia’s <a href="https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/">fluid type scale calculator</a> and <a href="https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/">fluid space calculator</a> can help you quickly spin up scales more fitting to a particular project.</p>

    
      <h2 id="cu.css-features">cu.css features</h2>
      <ul>
<li>Built using the CUBE CSS methodology.</li>
<li>Fluid responsive design for space and type.</li>

</ul>

    
      <h2 id="why-cu.css">Why cu.css?</h2>
      <p>Unlike popular frameworks, which are often overkill or try to reinvent CSS entirely, working with a CSS methodology, like CUBE CSS, helps to brings structure and consistency to your CSS, while remaining lightweight and flexible.</p>
<p>For this reason, I’ve always prefered to adopt a CSS methodology over full blown framework. But when you’re busy developing websites, you often need a little more than just a methodology to give you a headstart. That’s why <em>cu.css</em> exists.</p>
<p><em>cu.css</em> is a lightweight framework built using a solid CSS methodology, that helps to kick start projects quickly and offers the basics to build upon, in a way that respects CSS.</p>
