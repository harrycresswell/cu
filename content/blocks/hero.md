Use `.hero`, combined with [region](/utilities#region) and [flow](/utilities#flow) to create a distictive headline section for pages. For the sake of clarity, pipes are used to [group classes](https://cube.fyi/grouping.html#grouping-order), as seen below.

<div class="hero | region | flow">
  <h1>A modern CSS framework</h1>
  <p>cu.css is built using Cube CSS and Utopia fluid responsive design.</p>
</div>

```
<div class="hero | region | flow">
  <h1>Some page title</h1>
  <p>Some page description</p>
</div>
```
