title: Blocks

According to [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/block.html#block);

> “A block is a skeletal component or organisational structure. To compare it to common user interface elements: it is a card element or a button element.”

Personally, I like to think of Blocks as commonly used design patterns, which global styles, compositions and utilities don’t necessarily account for. For example, there is no pre-existing HTML `<card>` element and though we may be able to create a card using utilities alone, creating a `.card` block makes life much easier.

*cu.css* includes 4 blocks, the CSS for which can be found in `assets/scss/blocks`.
