In *cu.css*, [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) creates a fluid responsive design system, without the need for breakpoints. 

With some clever use of the [Clamp function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp), Utopia creates a scale of CSS Custom Propoerties for both typography and space, that permeates through the entire framework.

*cu.css* uses sensible defaults in the Minor Third and Major Third scale. However, Utopiaâ€™s [fluid type scale calculator](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/) and [fluid space calculator](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/) can help you quickly spin up scales more fitting to a particular project.
