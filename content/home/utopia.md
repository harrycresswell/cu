[Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) is used in *cu.css* to create a fluid responsive design system, without the need to use breakpoints. 

With some clever use of the [Clamp function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp), Utopia creates a scale of CSS Custom Properties for both typography and space. This scale is utilised by the entire framework to create harmony and rhythm, no matter the device.

*cu.css* uses the Minor Third and Major Third scale to create sensible defaults. However, Utopiaâ€™s [fluid type scale calculator](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/) and [fluid space calculator](https://utopia.fyi/space/calculator/) can help you quickly spin up scales more fitting to a particular project.
