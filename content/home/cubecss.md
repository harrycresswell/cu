Cube CSS is a methodology orientated towards simplicity, pragmatism and consistency.
Utopia is a tool that helps create fluid responsive type and space, without breakpoints.

There are, however, a few difference from Cube CSS. 

Unlike Cube CSS, however, this starter doesnâ€™t abstract design tokens away from the CSS, or generate utility classes for you. 

Instead, tokens are added directly to the CSS in the form of CSS Custom Properties. And utility classes are created by hand, as and when they are required. 

This keeps things simple, approachable and most of all, dependency free.
