Unlike popular frameworks, which are often overkill or try to reinvent CSS entirely, working with a CSS methodology, like CUBE CSS, helps to bring structure and consistency to your CSS, while remaining lightweight and flexible. 

For this reason, I’ve always preferred to adopt a CSS methodology over full blown framework. But when you’re busy developing websites, you often need a little more than just a methodology to give you a headstart. That’s why *cu.css* exists.

*cu.css* is a lightweight framework built using a solid CSS methodology. It will help you kick start your projects quickly, offering a base to build upon, in a way that respects CSS.

## Extensible by design

While no two projects are ever exactly the same, under the hood, a good bit of the CSS often still is. *cu.css* is that “good bit” of CSS.

How you choose to extend *cu.css* is very much up to you. You may find you only need to update a few CSS custom properties, or you may want to turn it into something completely unrecognisable.

Either way, working with existing methodologies will make the process much easier. 

You will find plenty of documentation online about how to work with both CUBE CSS and Utopia, meaning that anyone with some knowledge of CSS should be able to adopt this project and extend it in a consistent and familiar way.
