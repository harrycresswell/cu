Unlike popular frameworks, which are often overkill or try to reinvent CSS entirely, working with a CSS methodology, like CUBE CSS, helps to brings structure and consistency to your CSS, while remaining lightweight and flexible. 

For this reason, I’ve always prefered to adopt a CSS methodology over full blown framework. But when you’re busy developing websites, you often need a little more than just a methodology to give you a headstart. That’s why *cu.css* exists.

*cu.css* is a lightweight framework built using a solid CSS methodology, that helps to kick start projects quickly and offers the basics to build upon, in a way that respects CSS.
