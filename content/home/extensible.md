While no two projects are ever exactly the same, under the hood, a good bit of the CSS often still is. *cu.css* is that “good bit” of CSS.

How you choose to extend *cu.css* is very much up to you. You may find you only need to update a few CSS custom properties, or you may want to turn it into something completely unrecognisable.

Either way, working with existing methodologies will make the process much easier. 

You will find plenty of documentation online about how to work with both CUBE CSS and Utopia, meaning that anyone with some knowledge of CSS should be able to adopt this project and extend it in a consistent and familiar way.
