You can use the `[hidden]` attribute to prevent the browser from rendering content. This is useful when you are manipulating content with JavaScript. 

```
<p hidden>This paragraph is hidden from the browser and will not render</p>
```

If you donâ€™t want content to be visible in the browser, but it should remain accessible to assistive technologies, such as screen readers, then use the [visually hidden](/utilities/#visually-hidden) utility class instead.
