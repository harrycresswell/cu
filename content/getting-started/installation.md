There are currently two different ways to install *cu.css* in your project, depending on whether you prefer to work with CSS or SASS. 

### Installing CSS

If you plan to work with CSS:

1. [Download the full project from Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/cu/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), then:
2. Copy the [public/css/main.min.css]() file into your project.
3. Copy the [static/fonts]() directory into your project.


<!-- Include via a CDN.

Paste the following into the `<head>` of your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cu.css@2/out/cu.css">
``` -->



### Installing SASS

If you plan to work with the SASS files:

1. [Download the full project from Github](https://github.com/harrycresswell/cu/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), then:
2. Copy [the scss directory](https://github.com/harrycresswell/cu/tree/2028d2df88602bc79f67937a2f323f5c806e7e3b/assets/scss) into your project.
3. Copy [the fonts directory](https://github.com/harrycresswell/cu/tree/2028d2df88602bc79f67937a2f323f5c806e7e3b/static/fonts) into your project.
