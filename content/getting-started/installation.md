There are a few different ways to install cu.css, depending on which flavour you would like to use.

## CSS

Paste the following into the `<head>` of your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cu.css@2/out/cu.css">
```



## SASS

If you plan to work with the SASS files, either:

1. [download cu.css from Github]() and copy the SCSS folder into your project.
2. Clone cu.css from GitHub git@github.com:harrycresswell/cu.git and copy the SCSS folder into your project.
3. Install cu.css using a package manager: `npm install cu-css`
