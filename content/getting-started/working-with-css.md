If you plan to customise or build upon *cu.css* to suit your project, then a good place to start is by unminifying the CSS with a [CSS Formatter](https://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/), to make it easier to work with.

Keep in mind, if you change the file name of your CSS, you will also need to update the link in the `<head>` of your pages.
