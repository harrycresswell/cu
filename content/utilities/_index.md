title: Utilities

*cu.css* include a handful of utilities. **Utilities help to solve common, yet specific problems found throughout a project**. 

According to [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/utility.html): “A utility, in the context of CUBE CSS, is a CSS class that does one job and does that one job well.”

It’s important to note, *cu.css* doesn’t make use of any third-party tooling to generate utility classes. Instead, create any additional utilities by hand, as and when they are required.

The CSS for these utilities can be found in `assets/scss/utilities`.
