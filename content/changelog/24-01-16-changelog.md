This site now has a changelog page ([/changelog](/changelog)) to record and keep track of new features, bug fixes and improvements. 

I’ve also added the following:

- 404 page template
- Missing favicons

And, I’ve added some functionality that causes external links to open in a new tab. You can read more about this in [Markdown Render Hooks](https://gohugo.io/templates/render-hooks/) in the Hugo docs.

Then a few fixes:

- Added missing font directory link in [installation docs](/getting-started/)
- Committed the /public folder to the repo
- Added missing public/css folder link also in installation docs.
