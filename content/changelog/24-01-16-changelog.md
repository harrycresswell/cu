Mostly new features, bug fixes and improvements to the cu.css website. No changes to the css framework itself.

## New features

This site now has this fancy changelog page, to record and keep track of new features, bug fixes and improvements. 

I’ve also added some functionality that causes external links to open in a new tab. You can read more about this in [Markdown Render Hooks](https://gohugo.io/templates/render-hooks/) in the Hugo docs.

## Bug fixes

- Added missing font directory link in [installation docs](/getting-started/)
- Committed the `/public` folder to the repo
- Added missing `public/css` folder link also in installation docs.

## Improvements

I’ve also added the following:

- 404 page template
- Missing favicons
