## Bug fixes 

- Switch to Utopia space custom property for `.cluster` gap fallback value.
- Switch `h1`, `h2` and `h3` line-height from from hardcoded `1` value to use `--line-height-compact` custom property.

## Improvements

- Change order of content sections on the homepage.
- Change the word “framework” to “boilerplate” when describing *cu.css*. This more acurrately describes what *cu.css* is. See [Boilerplates vs. frameworks](https://gomakethings.com/boilerplates-vs.-frameworks/) from Chris Ferdinandi for more.
- Various content updates to homepage sections.
