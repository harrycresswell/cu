*cu.css* includes a handful of compositions. **Compositions create flexible layouts, helping to bring structure to whatever content they contain**. 

According to [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/): “The composition layer’s job is to create flexible, component-agnostic layout systems that support as many variants of content as possible.”

To use a composition, define a container element with a composition class applied. The child items of that parent container will now adopt the composition.


The CSS for all compositions can be found in `assets/scss/compositions`.
