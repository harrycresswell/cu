title: Compositions
---

*cu.css* includes a handful of compositions. These classes create flexible layouts, helping to bring structure to whatever content you decide to use them with. 

According to [cube.fyi](https://cube.fyi/): “The composition layer’s job is to create flexible, component-agnostic layout systems that support as many variants of content as possible.”

The CSS for these compositions can be found in `assets/scss/compositions`.
