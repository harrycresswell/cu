Use the anchor element, a.k.a `<a>` tag to link to different pages

```
<a href="/about">About</a>
```

Links look [like this](/), by default. 

But you can also use use the data attribute `data-variant="naked"` to make them look like text.

```
<a href="/" data-variant="naked">A naked link</a>
```

An example of `data-variant="naked"` being used on links can be seen in the navigation found at the top of each page on this website.
