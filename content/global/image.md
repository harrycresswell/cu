Use the `<img>` element in the usual way. Images have `max-width: 100%` applied, ensuring they fill the entire width of parent element, as weâ€™ve come to expect.

<img src="/img/brian-mcgowan-HiftPDiIVTY-unsplash.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />

```
<img src="/img/brian-mcgowan-HiftPDiIVTY-unsplash.jpg" alt="" />
```

To give your image a caption, place your `<img>` inside a `<figure>` and use `<figcaption>` for the caption.
