*cu.css* is a lightweight CSS framework that makes it quicker to start using [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) and [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) in your projects. To get the most out of *cu.css*, you will need to be familiar with both of these approaches. 

*cu.css* isn’t a fully fledged CSS framework, like Tailwind or Bootstrap. If anything, it’s more of a boilerplate or starting point, designed to be built upon and expanded as you see fit.
